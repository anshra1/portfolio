# 🎨 UI & UX Engineering

This domain covers everything the user sees and interacts with. Our goal is to create "App Store quality" interfaces that feel responsive and alive.

## 🎬 Animations
Standard Flutter animations can be boilerplate-heavy. We prioritize a declarative, extension-based approach.

*   **Rule of Thumb:** Use `flutter_animate` for all standard UI transitions (fades, slides, shimmers) and tactile feedback. Only use manual `AnimationControllers` for complex game logic or highly custom gesture-driven physics.
