Here is the "Progressive Refinement" Workflow rewritten
  specifically for BLoC / State Management methods.

  This workflow focuses on User Experience (UX), State Transitions,
  and Side Effects.

  1. Define Purpose (The User Story)
  Focus: The user interaction and the desired visual outcome.
   * Example: "When the user opens the screen, load the projects. If
     successful, show the list. If it fails, show an error message."
   * Role: Sets the UX Goal.

  2. Functional Flow & State Machine (The Lifecycle)
  Focus: The journey of the state (Initial $\rightarrow$ Loading
  $\rightarrow$ Success/Failure).
   * The Flow: User Event (LoadProjects) $\rightarrow$ Emit Loading
     $\rightarrow$ Call UseCase $\rightarrow$ Check Result
     (Left/Right) $\rightarrow$ Emit Final State.
   * The UX Scan (The "What if?"):
       * Debounce: If the user spams the refresh button, do we call
         the API 10 times?
       * Empty State: What if the API returns an empty list? Do we
         show Success([]) or a specific Empty state?
       * Preservation: If we refresh, do we clear the current list
         (show spinner) or keep showing the old list while loading?
   * Role: Defines the Behavior.

  3. State Decisions & Dependency Setup (The Blueprint)
  Focus: Freezing the rules for state emission.
   * Decisions:
       * "On Event: Emit ProjectLoading immediately."
       * "On Success (Right): Emit ProjectLoaded(projects)."
       * "On Failure (Left): Emit ProjectError(message)."
       * "Transformation: The BLoC does not filter data; it only
         passes params to the UseCase."
   * Mock Setup:
       * Mock UseCase: Needs to simulate Right(List) and
         Left(Failure).
   * Role: The Specification.

  4. Test List Generation (The Verification Plan)
  Focus: Verifying the stream of states.
   * The Tests (`bloc_test`):
       1. emits [Loading, Loaded] when usecase returns data
       2. emits [Loading, Error] when usecase returns failure
       3. emits [Loading, Empty] when usecase returns empty list (if
          applicable)
       4. does not emit state if event is added after closed
   * Role: The Checklist.

  5. Execution (Red-Green-Refactor)
   * Write the test (expecting the sequence of states) $\rightarrow$
     Write the event handler $\rightarrow$ Pass.
