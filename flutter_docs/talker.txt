Talker 
Get Started 
Follow these steps to the coolest experience in error handling

Add dependency 
dependencies:
  talker: ^5.1.9
Easy to use 
You can use Talker instance everywhere in your app
Simple and concise syntax will help you with this

  import 'package:talker/talker.dart';

  final talker = Talker();

  /// Just logs
  talker.warning('The pizza is over 😥');
  talker.debug('Thinking about order new one 🤔');

  // Handling Exception's and Error's
  try {
    throw Exception('The restaurant is closed ❌');
  } catch (e, st) {
    talker.handle(e, st);
  }

  /// Just logs
  talker.info('Ordering from other restaurant...');
  talker.info('Payment started...');
  talker.good('Payment completed. Waiting for pizza 🍕');
More examples you can get there



⚙️ Customization 
Configure the error handler and logger for yourself

final talker = Talker(
    settings: const TalkerSettings(
      /// You can enable/disable all talker processes with this field
      enabled: true,
      /// You can enable/disable saving logs data in history
      useHistory: true,
      /// Length of history that saving logs data
      maxHistoryItems: 100,
      /// You can enable/disable console logs
      useConsoleLogs: true,
    ),
    /// Setup your implementation of logger
    logger: TalkerLogger(),
    ///etc...
  );
More examples you can get here

Custom logs 
With Talker you can create your custom log message types.
And you have full customization control over them!

class YourCustomLog extends TalkerLog { 
    YourCustomLog(String super.message); 

    /// Log title 
    static get getTitle => 'Custom';

    /// Log key 
    static get getKey => 'custom_log_key';

    /// Log color 
    static get getPen => AnsiPen()..yellow(); 

    /// The following overrides are required because the base class expects instance getters,
    /// but we use static getters to allow for easy customization and reuse of colors, titles, and keys.
    /// This approach works around limitations in the base class API, which does not support passing custom values
    /// directly to the constructor or as parameters, so we override the instance getters to return the static values.
    @override 
    String get title => getTitle; 

    @override 
    String get key => getKey; 

    @override 
    AnsiPen get pen => getPen; 
 } 

final talker = Talker();
talker.logCustom(YourCustomLog('Something like your own service message'));


Change log colors 
Starting from version 4.0.0, you have the ability to fully customize all logs colors. You can set your own color for any type of logs. For example, you can choose red for HTTP responses and green for errors—whatever suits your preference 😁

The map is now structured as {String: AnsiPen}.

String Key 
The String key serves as an identifier for a specific log type (e.g., HTTP, error, info, etc.).

Default log types are accessible via the key field in the TalkerLogType enum.
Developers can also define custom log pen by providing their own string keys, like 'custom_log_key'.
final talker = Talker(
  settings: TalkerSettings(
    colors: {
      // Colors for default log types can be defined with AnsiPen
      TalkerLogType.httpResponse.key: AnsiPen()..red(),
      TalkerLogType.error.key: AnsiPen()..green(),
      TalkerLogType.info.key: AnsiPen()..blue(),

      // Custom Logs can be defined

      // ... from the custom log's key name
      'custom_log_key': AnsiPen()..yellow(),

      // ... or from the variable
      YourCustomLog.getKey: AnsiPen()..yellow(),

      // ... or using the variable and the previously defined custom color for conformity
      YourCustomLog.getKey: YourCustomLog.getPen
    },
  ),
);


Talker have default color scheme. You can check it in TalkerSettings class

Change log titles 
Starting from version 4.0.0, you have the ability to fully customize all logs titles. You can set your own title for any type of logs.

The map is now structured as {String: AnsiPen}.

String Key 
The String key serves as an identifier for a specific log type (e.g., HTTP, error, info, etc.).

Default log types are accessible via the getKey field in the TalkerLogType enum.
Developers can also define custom log title by providing their own string keys, like 'custom_log_key'.
final talker = Talker(
  settings: TalkerSettings(
    titles: {
      // Titles for default log types can be defined with strings
      TalkerLogType.exception.key: 'Whatever you want',
      TalkerLogType.error.key: 'E',
      TalkerLogType.info.key: 'i',

      // Custom Logs can be defined

      // ... from the custom log's key name
      'custom_log_key': "new custom title!",

      // ... or from the variable
      YourCustomLog.getKey: "new custom title!",

      // ... or using the variable and the previously defined custom title for conformity
      YourCustomLog.getKey: YourCustomLog.getTitle      
    },
  ),
);


Talker have default titles scheme. You can check it in TalkerSettings class

TalkerObserver 
TalkerObserver is a mechanism that allows observing what is happening inside Talker from the outside.

import 'package:talker/talker.dart';

class ExampleTalkerObserver extends TalkerObserver {
  ExampleTalkerObserver();

  @override
  void onError(TalkerError err) {
    /// Send data to your error tracking system like Sentry or backend
    super.onError(err);
  }

  @override
  void onException(TalkerException exception) {
    /// Send Exception to your error tracking system like Sentry or backend
    super.onException(exception);
  }

  @override
  void onLog(TalkerDataInterface log) {
    /// Send log message to Grafana or backend
    super.onLog(log);
  }
}

final observer = ExampleTalkerObserver();
final talker = Talker(observer: observer);
You can use it to transmit data about logs to external sources such as Crashlytics, Sentry, Grafana, or your own analytics service, etc.

Talker Flutter 
Get Started Flutter 
Talker Flutter is an extension for the Dart Talker package that adds extra functionality to make it easier for you to handle logs, errors, and exceptions in your Flutter applications.

Add dependency 
dependencies:
  talker_flutter: ^5.1.9
Setup 
import 'package:talker_flutter/talker_flutter.dart';

final talker = TalkerFlutter.init();

// Handle exceptions and errors
try {
  // your code...
} catch (e, st) {
    talker.handle(e, st, 'Exception with');
}

// Log your app info
talker.info('App is started');
talker.critical('❌ Houston, we have a problem!');
talker.error('🚨 The service is not available');
❗️ Log messages integrity 
Most of flutter logging packages either cut messages in the console, or cant dope colored messages in the iOS console. But Talker is not one of them...

Talker uses the optimal method for logging depending on the Operating system on which it runs

But to do this, you need to use the initialization given in the example. Only with TalkerFlutter.init()

As result of this method you will get the same instance of Talker as when creating it through the Talker() constructor but with logging default initialization

TalkerScreen 
Often you need to check what happening in the application when there is no console at hand.
There is a TalkerScreen widget from talker_flutter package for this situations.

For better understanding how it works check Web Demo page









TalkerScreen	TalkerFilter	TalkerActions	TalkerSettings
Easy to use 
You can use TalkerScreen everywhere in your app
At Screen, BottomSheet, ModalDialog, etc...

import 'package:talker_flutter/talker_flutter.dart';

final talker = TalkerFlutter.init();

Navigator.of(context).push(
  MaterialPageRoute(
    builder: (context) => TalkerScreen(talker: talker),
  )
);
See more in TalkerScreen usage example

Customization 
Starting from version 4.0.0, you have the ability to fully customize your TalkerScreen display. You can set your own color for any type of logs. For example, you can choose red for HTTP responses and green for errors—whatever suits your preference 😁









How to set custom colors ? 
To set your custom colors, you need to pass a TalkerScreenTheme object to the TalkerScreen constructor, with a Map containing the desired colors.

The Map is structured as {log type: color}. TalkerLogType is an identifier for a specific log type (e.g., HTTP, error, info, etc.), and each log type in Talker has its own field in the enum.

import 'package:talker_flutter/talker_flutter.dart';

final talker = TalkerFlutter.init();

TalkerScreen(
  talker: talker,
  theme: const TalkerScreenTheme(
    logColors: {

      // Default log type colors can be overridden from the color object
      TalkerLogType.httpResponse.key: Color(0xFF26FF3C),
      // ... or from flutter material colors
      TalkerLogType.error.key: Colors.redAccent,
      // ... or from ARGB values
      TalkerLogType.info.key: Color.fromARGB(255, 0, 255, 247),

      // Custom logs can override their terminal colors 
      
      // ... using the key string
      'custom_log_key': Colors.green,
      
      // ... or from the variable
      YourCustomLog.getKey: Colors.green,

      // ... but they cannot use the previously defined color from the custom log object,
      // ... because flutter doesn't display ansi colors in widgets.
      // ... However, you can use material colors, the color object, or ARGB values for them
      YourCustomLog.getKey: Color(0xFF26FF3C)
    },
  )
)
TalkerScreenTheme 
You can set custom backagroud, card and text colors for TalkerScreen with TalkerScreenTheme

TalkerScreenTheme(
  cardColor: Colors.grey[700]!,
  backgroundColor: Colors.grey[800]!,
  textColor: Colors.white,
  logColors: {
    /// Your logs colors...
  },
)
TalkerRouteObserver 
Observer for a navigator.
If you want to keep a record of page transitions in your application, you've found what you're looking for.

You can use TalkerRouteObserver with any routing package
From auto_route to basic Flutter Navigator

Navigator 
final talker = Talker();

MaterialApp(
  navigatorObservers: [
    TalkerRouteObserver(talker),
  ],
)
auto_route 
final talker = Talker();

MaterialApp.router(
  routerDelegate: AutoRouterDelegate(
    appRouter,
    navigatorObservers: () => [
      TalkerRouteObserver(talker),
    ],
  ),
),
auto_route v7 
final talker = Talker();

MaterialApp.router(
  routerConfig: _appRouter.config(
    navigatorObservers: () => [
      TalkerRouteObserver(talker),
    ],
  ),
),
go_router 
final talker = Talker();

GoRouter(
  observers: [TalkerRouteObserver(talker)],
)
TalkerMonitor 
If you want to check the status of your application in a short time
TalkerMonitor will be the best solution for you

Monitor is a filtered quick information about http requests, exceptions, errors, warnings, etc... count

You will find Monitor at the TalkerScreen page



For better understanding how it works check Web Demo page

TalkerWrapper 
In addition talker_flutter is able to show default and custom error messages and another status messages via TalkerWrapper



import 'package:talker_flutter/talker_flutter.dart';

final talker = TalkerFlutter.init();

TalkerWrapper(
  talker: talker,
  options: const TalkerWrapperOptions(
    enableErrorAlerts: true,
  ),
  child: /// Application or the screen where you need to show messages
),
More Features And Examples 
Custom UI error messages 
In order to understand in more details - you can check this article "Showing Flutter custom error messages"

TalkerWrapper usage example

ShopApp example 
See full application example with BLoC and navigation here

The talker_flutter package have a lot of another widgets like TalkerBuilder, TalkerListener, etc. You can find all of them in code documentation.

Integrations 
In addition to the basic functionality, talker was conceived as a tool for creating lightweight loggers for the main activities of your application

You can use ready out of the box packages like talker_dio_logger, talker_bloc_logger and talker_riverpod_logger or create your own packages.

Talker Dio Logger 
Lightweight, simple and pretty solution for logging if your app use dio as http-client

This is how the logs of your http requests will look in the console 

Getting started 
Follow these steps to use this package

Add dependency 
dependencies:
  talker_dio_logger: ^5.1.9
Usage 
Just add TalkerDioLogger to your dio instance and it will work

final dio = Dio();
dio.interceptors.add(
    TalkerDioLogger(
        settings: const TalkerDioLoggerSettings(
          printRequestHeaders: true,
          printResponseHeaders: true,
          printResponseMessage: true,
        ),
    ),
);
Customization 
To provide hight usage exp here are a lot of settings and customization fields in TalkerDioLoggerSettings. You can setup all wat you want. For example:

Off/on http request or reposnse logs 
You can toggle reponse / request printing and headers including

final dio = Dio();
dio.interceptors.add(
    TalkerDioLogger(
        settings: const TalkerDioLoggerSettings(
          // All http responses enabled for console logging
          printResponseData: true,
          // All http requests disabled for console logging
          printRequestData: false,
          // Reposnse logs including http - headers
          printResponseHeaders: true,
          // Request logs without http - headersa
          printRequestHeaders: false,
        ),
    ),
);
Change http logs colors 
Setup your custom http-log colors. You can set color for requests, responses and errors in TalkerDioLoggerSettings

TalkerDioLoggerSettings(
  // Blue http requests logs in console
  requestPen: AnsiPen()..blue(),
  // Green http responses logs in console
  responsePen: AnsiPen()..green(),
  // Error http logs in console
  errorPen: AnsiPen()..red(),
);
Filter http logs 
For example if your app has a private functionality and you don't need to store this functionality logs in talker - you can use filters

TalkerDioLoggerSettings(
  // All http request without "/secure" in path will be printed in console 
  requestFilter: (RequestOptions options) => !options.path.contains('/secure'),
  // All http responses with status codes different than 301 will be printed in console 
  responseFilter: (response) => response.statusCode != 301,
)
Using with Talker 
You can add your talker instance for TalkerDioLogger if your app already uses Talker. In this case, all logs and errors will fall into your unified tracking system

final talker = Talker();
final dio = Dio();
dio.interceptors.add(TalkerDioLogger(talker: talker));
Talker BLoC Logger 
Lightweight, simple and pretty solution for logging if your app use BLoC as state management

This is how the logs of your BLoC's event calling and state emits will look in the console 

Getting started 
Follow these steps to use this package

Add dependency 
dependencies:
  talker_bloc_logger: ^5.1.9
Usage 
Just set TalkerBlocObserver as Bloc.observer field and it will work

import 'package:talker_bloc_observer/talker_bloc_observer.dart';

Bloc.observer = TalkerBlocObserver();
Customization 
To provide hight usage exp here are a lot of settings and customization fields in TalkerBlocLoggerSettings. You can setup all wat you want. For example:

Off/on events, transitions, changes, creation, close 
You can toggle all bloc event types printing

Bloc.observer = TalkerBlocObserver(
    settings: TalkerBlocLoggerSettings(
      enabled: true,
      printChanges: true,
      printClosings: true,
      printCreations: true,
      printEvents: true,
      printTransitions: true,
    ),
  );
Full/truncated state and event data 
You can choose to have the logs of events and states in the BLoC displayed in the console in either full or truncated form

Bloc.observer = TalkerBlocObserver(
    settings: TalkerBlocLoggerSettings(
      printEventFullData: false,
      printStateFullData: false,
    ),
  );
Filter bloc logs 
You can output logs to the console for specific events and states only, using a filter

Bloc.observer = TalkerBlocObserver(
    settings: TalkerBlocLoggerSettings(
      // If you want log only AuthBloc transitions
      transitionFilter: (bloc, transition) =>
          bloc.runtimeType.toString() == 'AuthBloc',
      // If you want log only AuthBloc events
      eventFilter: (bloc, event) => bloc.runtimeType.toString() == 'AuthBloc',
    ),
  );
